<h1>Web app for dance recommendations</h1>
<p></p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
I see dozens of questions every week from fellow cover dancers, who ask for recommendations. They want an advice on which choreography would suit their level, considering number of members in their team.
This app is designed to deliver such advice as easy and fast as possible.

<h3>How?</h3>
Main parameters to choose a dance for cover dancers are: 
<li> number of members in a group (it should be the same as in their team); </li>
<li> whether a dance is from a boy group or a girl group (because stylistic choices differ, and everyone has preferences); </li>
<li> level of difficulty, suitable for skills and experience </li>

These parameters are used to select most suitable ideas from the database.
While level of difficulty is a very subjective thing, I have enough expertise in the field (18 years of dancing and 3 years of teaching) to rank choreographies based on my own system.

<h3>What's next?</h3>
The app is functional, but of course there is room for improvement, and the plans are:
<li> expanding the knowledge base; </li>
<li> adding parameters to fine-tune the search; </li>
<li> improving UX/UI </li>
